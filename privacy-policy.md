##### Effective as on **8th September, 2014**

<p class="intro">At Playlyfe, we respect and value your privacy.
Our aim with Playlyfe is
to make your experience while accessing Playlyfe.com (“Playlyfe”)
as safe as possible.
Keeping that goal in mind, we have developed this privacy policy
(“Policy”), which sets our our privacy practices and helps you
understand what information is collected, and how we handle the
information.
This Privacy Notice applies only to the operation of websites that
directly link to this Notice when you click on “Privacy”
in the website footer.</p>


### What We May Collect

We collect information which is volunteered by you, (such as your
full name, your gender, age and email address or any other such
information given at the time of registration, or by updating your
Playlyfe profile), information about which pages you visit on our
site (via third-party services such as Google Analytics), and email
addresses of those who communicate with us via email.

When you log into Playlyfe, and use any app built on top of our
platform, we also collect information about your behaviour (which
tasks you trigger), your status and scores within the app, your
standing on the leaderboards, and other miscellaneous activities
within the game (when you invite someone into your game, etc).

We may use cookies or store your Internet Protocol address
or use other technologies to collect and store information about your
use of our website on our servers. We may use this information to
fight spam, malware, and identity theft; which we may use to
personalize your experience and or to generate aggregate,
non-identifying information about how our services are being used.
If and when applicable, the Playlyfe Site uses the cookies to assist
us with analyzing site traffic, help us determine the effectiveness of
content on our site and to manage our advertising on other websites.


### Email Communications with Us

We may occasionally need to email you some information for
administrative purposes, such as while answering support tickets, or
for informing you about your account or to intimate any updates to
our services or policies. These communications are an integral part
of Playlyfe Services, and you may not out-out of these Administrative
communications.

We will **never** email you to ask for your password, or other account
information. If you ever receive such an email,
[send it to us](mailto:support@playlyfe.com "Playlyfe Support")
so that we can take appropriate action against the perpetrator of such
a nasty deed.


### How We Use Your Information

We will use your Personal Information to respond to requests
you may make of us, and from time to time, we may refer to the
provided Personal Information to better understand your needs and
how we can improve our websites, products, and services. We may also
use your Personal Information to contact you via email, postal mail,
or phone call and provide you with general information about our
products and services. We may also enhance or merge Personal
Information with data obtained from third parties for the same
purposes.

Any NPI transferred by you in connection with your visit to the
Playlyfe Site may be included in databases owned and maintained by
Playlyfe or its agents. Playlyfe retains all rights to these
databases and the information contained in them.

You may be able to disable use of cookies through the options on
your web browser, but please note that you may not be able to use
all of the features on our websites if you disable use of cookies.
The Playlyfe Site may include social media features, such as
“Facebook” or “Twitter” buttons. These features may collect your IP
address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a
cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media
features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on
our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by
the privacy practices of the company providing them.


### Disclosure of Your Information

The information we collect is used to provide Playlyfe Services to you
and to improve and update these Services and content, and to prevent
abuse of our Services.

We may share your Personal Information with agents, contractors or
partners of Playlyfe in connection with services that these
individuals or entities perform for, or with, Playlyfe. These
agents, contractors or partners are allowed to use this data only to
provide you with Playlyfe Services, or services for which they engage
with Playlyfe (for example, some companies may develop apps which use
Playlyfe Services within them).

We may share Personal Information with third-party service providers
(e.g., email service providers, data storage and processing
facilities) in order for those service providers to perform business
functions for us or on our behalf (for example, we may use a
third-party email service to send in-app notifications). After the
information is provided to such third parties, the subsequent use or
disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties’
privacy policies and practices.

We may also disclose the information we receive; if required by law,
such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

If we are acquired by or merged with another company, and your
information becomes subject to a different privacy policy, we'll
notify you before the transfer. At such a time, we may disclose any
information in our possession or control, including aggregate Personal
Information and NPI, which could serve as one of our business assets.


### Public User Content

Playlyfe is meant to create gamified systems, and you may create games
which are public in nature, meaning anyone can come and join the game
without an express invitation or permission from you. These games may
also be shared by others over the internet.

You are free to make any game non-public at any time in the future, or
even delete the game, but all activities generated by users may be
stored indefinitely on our servers.


### Data Security

We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from
our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100%
secure, therefore, it’s impossible to guarantee the absolute security
of this data. You use the service at your own risk, and you are
responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account
(such as keeping your password secret).


### Data Retention

We retain the your information, and that of your end-users as long as
the account exists with us or as needed to provide our Services.
We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with
our legal and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
our agreements. End User Information is retained on our servers in its
original form for up to six months. Other information related to the
Playlyfe Platform, as in scores, achievements or rewards earned by
the End Users, might be retained for up to eighteen months before it
is aggregated or deleted. If and when the Customer and Playlyfe
relationship ends, End User Information may be deleted after thirty
(30) days, otherwise, said information will be anonymized and
aggregated.


### Changes to this Policy

Playlyfe may periodically update this policy. As and when we do any
significant change to the Policy, we will notify you by
sending a notice to your primary email address, as specified in your
Playlyfe account or by placing a prominent notice on our site before
the changes take effect.

The most current version of the policy can always be found here, and
we will keep an archive of all former versions of our policy
[here](https://github.com/playlyfe/policy "Playlyfe Policy on Github").
